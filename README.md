# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Build APK (WebView wrapper)

This project now wraps your website in a WebView. To build a production APK or AAB using EAS:

1. Install EAS CLI:

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

2. Login to Expo (follow prompts):

```bash
eas login
```

3. Configure credentials and build (preview builds an APK):

```bash
eas build -p android --profile preview
# or production (AAB):
eas build -p android --profile production
```

After the build completes, download the generated APK from the Expo dashboard and install it on your device.
